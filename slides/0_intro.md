# The MODE Goals

* "We aim to create a versatile, scalable, customizable infrastructure, where a generic detector design task can be encoded, along with all the players (pattern reco, nuisances, cost constraints, a well constructed objective function)"
  * Then **automatic scanning** of the space of design solutions becomes possible!

* This doesn't replace the work of the physicist! We aim at **extending the physicist's abilities** by producing **design assistance tools**, focusing on diagnostic tools and visualizations for **interpretability**

* We don't propose the one *optimal solution* to a given problem, we aim at proposing a **distribution of solutions** in a region of optimality, to assist design choices!

* Optimization targets are not only strictly physics-related (e.g. significances): we consider also **financial cost** and other constraints in the optimization

# The MODE Goals

* We identified and started studying some **relatively simple use cases**: muon tomography detector optimization, calorimeter optimization

* Plan to proceed to other simple use cases (e.g. small detectors for HL_LHC), providing **proofs of concept of increasing complexity**
  * "*Every problem is difficult if you want to solve it well and make an impact*"
